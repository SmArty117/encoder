# encoder
A simple app that scrambles messages. Created as a personal project.


It allows users to encode and decode a messages. 
This is achieved by using a number of strings and an equal number of integers. The intention is to have the strings be public, and the integers used for encoding be known only by the people for whom the message is intended. More information is available in the right hand menu inside the app. 

Unfortunately, this can only be run using python 2.7.5
